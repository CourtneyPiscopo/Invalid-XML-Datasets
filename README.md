# Invalid-XML-Datasets
This repository contains invalid XML files for software testing purposes. Datasets One and Two were created using two different Mutation Fuzzers, and Dataset Two was created using a Grammar Fuzzer.  The input files used to create Datasets One and Three were gathered using GitHub API (api_requests.py), by collecting .xml publicly accessible files.
