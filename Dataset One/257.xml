The Responsive extension for DataTables can be applied to a DataTable in one of two ways; with a specific class name on the table, or using the DataTables initialisation options. This method shows the latter, with the `r-init responsive` option being set to the boolean value `true`.

The `r-init responsive` option can be given as a boolean value, or as an object with configuration options. If as a boolean, as in this case, the default options are used.
